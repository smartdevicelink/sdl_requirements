## Functional requirements

1.  
In case  
PROJECTION (isMedia = true) mobile app with `<appID>` is running in any HMILevel other than FULL on HMI  
and SDL receives SDL.ActivateApp with this `<appID>` from HMI  

SDL must  
respond 'SUCCESS, success:true' to HMI in case of NO other failures  
send OnHMIStatus (FULL, AUDIBLE) to this app  

2.  
In case  
PROJECTION (isMedia = false) mobile app with `<appID>` in any HMILevel other than FULL on HMI
and SDL receives SDL.ActivateApp with this `<appID>` from HMI  

SDL must  
respond 'SUCCESS, success:true' to HMI in case of NO other failures  
send OnHMIStatus (FULL, NOT_AUDIBLE) to this app  

3. 
In case  
PROJECTION (isMedia = true) mobile app with `<appID>` in `<default_HMILevel>` due to postponed HMILevel resumption (postponed during VR session, Emergency_Event, Deactivate_HMI, PhoneCall)  
and SDL receives SDL.ActivateApp (`<appID>`) from HMI  

SDL must  
respond with 'SUCCESS, success:true' to HMI  
send OnHMIStatus (FULL, AUDIBLE) to this mobile app right after event-for-postponing HMILevel resumption ends (after SDL receives corresponding RPC about event end from HMI, i.e. VR.Stopped)  

4.  
In case  
PROJECTION (isMedia = false) mobile app with `<appID>` in `<default_HMILevel>` due to postponed HMILevel resumption (postponed during VR session, Emergency_Event, Deactivate_HMI, PhoneCall)  
and SDL receives SDL.ActivateApp (`<appID>`) from HMI  

SDL must  
respond with 'SUCCESS, success:true' to HMI  
send OnHMIStatus (FULL, NOT_AUDIBLE) to this mobile app right after event-for-postponing HMILevel resumption ends (after SDL receives corresponding RPC about event end from HMI, i.e. VR.Stopped)  

5.  
In case  
PROJECTION (isMedia = true) mobile app with `<appID>` in BACKGROUND and NOT_AUDIBLE due to active AUDIO_SOURCE  

and SDL receives from HMI:  
1 - OnEventChanged (AUDIO_SOURCE, isActive:false)  
2 - SDL.ActivateApp (`<appID>`)  

SDL must  
respond with 'SUCCESS, success:true' to HMI  
send OnHMIStatus (FULL, AUDIBLE) to this mobile app  

_Note: 
If HMI didn`t send OnEventChanged (AUDIO_SOURCE, isActive:false)  
SDL send OnHMIStatus AFTER event ends)_  

6.  
In case  
PROJECTION (isMedia = false) mobile app with `<appID>` in BACKGROUND and NOT_AUDIBLE due to active AUDIO_SOURCE  
and SDL receives SDL.ActivateApp (`<appID>`) from HMI  

SDL must  
respond with 'SUCCESS, success:true' to HMI  
send OnHMIStatus (FULL, NOT_AUDIBLE) to this mobile app  

7.  
In case  
PROJECTION (isMedia = true) mobile app with `<appID>` in LIMITED and AUDIBLE due to active EMBEDDED_NAVI  

and SDL receives from HMI:  
1 - OnEventChanged (EMBEDDED_NAVI, isActive:false)  
2 - SDL.ActivateApp (`<appID>`)  

SDL must  
respond with 'SUCCESS, success:true' to HMI  
send OnHMIStatus (FULL, AUDIBLE) to this mobile app

_Note:_ 
If HMI didn`t send OnEventChanged (EMBEDDED_NAVI, isActive:false)  
SDL behavior in this case - send OnHMIStatus AFTER event ends)_  

8.  
In case
PROJECTION (isMedia = false) mobile app with `<appID>` in BACKGROUND and NOT_AUDIBLE due to active EMBEDDED_NAVI  
and SDL receives SDL.ActivateApp (`<appID>`) from HMI  

SDL must  
respond with 'SUCCESS, success:true' to HMI  
send OnHMIStatus (FULL, NOT_AUDIBLE) to this mobile app
