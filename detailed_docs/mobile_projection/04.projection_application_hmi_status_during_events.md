## Use Case 1: Projection application's HMI Status during events

_Pre-conditions_  
a. mobile application is PROJECTION MEDIA type  
b. application is running in FULL or LIMITED HMILevel  

_Steps:_
1. SDL receives OnEventChanged (DEACTIVATE_HMI, isActive:true) from HMI

_Expected:_
2. SDL sets application to BACKGROUND HMILevel, NOT_AUDIBLE  
3. SDL receives notification from HMI that event is over  
4. SDL restores the HMILevel of app being in effect before event

**Alternative flow 1:**  
1.a.1 SDL receives notification about start of VR session from HMI  
1.a.1 SDL doesn't change app's HMILevel, sets application to NOT_AUDIBLE  
1.a.2 SDL reveives notification from HMI that event is over 
1.a.3 SDL restores audioStreamingState of app being in effect before event  

**Alternative flow 2:**  
1.b.1 SDL receives notification about active phone call from HMI  
1.b.2 2. SDL sets application to BACKGROUND HMILevel, NOT_AUDIBLE  
1.b.3 SDL receives notification from HMI that event is over  
1.b.4 SDL restores the HMILevel of app being in effect before event

**Alternative flow 3:**  
1.c.1 SDL receives notification about EMERGENCY_EVENT from HMI  
1.c.2 SDL doesn't change app's HMILevel, sets application to NOT_AUDIBLE  
1.c.3 SDL reveives notification from HMI that event is over  
1.c.4 SDL restores audioStreamingState of app being in effect before event 

**Alternative flow 4:**  
1.d.1 SDL receives OnAppDeactivated from HMI  
1.d.2 SDL sets application to LIMITED HMILevel 
1.d.3 SDL doesn't change app audioStreamingState  

**Alternative flow 5:**  
1.e.1 SDL receives OnEventChanged (AUDIO_SOURCE, isActive=true) from HMI  
1.e.2 SDL sets application to BACKGROUND HMILevel, NOT_AUDIBLE  
1.e.3 SDL receives notification from HMI that event is over  
1.e.4 SDL restores the HMILevel of app being in effect before event  

**Alternative flow 6:**  
1.f.1 SDL receives OnEventChanged (EMBEDDED_NAVI, isActive=true) from HMI  
1.f.2 SDL sets application to LIMITED HMILevel, doesn't change app's audioStreamingState  
1.f.3 SDL reveives notification from HMI that event is over  
1.f.4 SDL restores HMILevel of app being in effect before event 

_Exception:_  
1.f.1.a if PROJECTION app is non-media  
1.f.1.b SDL sets app to BACKGROUND HMILevel, NOT_AUDIBLE   
1.f.1.c SDL reveives notification from HMI that event is over  
1.f.1.d SDL restores HMILevel of app being in effect before event by sending 

**Alternative flow 7:**  
1.g.1 SDL receives notification about TTS session start from HMI and system supports audio mixing  
1.g.2 SDL doesn't change app's HMILevel, sets application to ATTENUATED  
1.g.3 SDL reveives notification from HMI that event is over  
1.g.4 SDL restores the audioStreamingState of app being in effect before event 

_Exception:_  
1.g.1.a SDL receives TTS.Started from HMI and system does not support audio mixing  
1.g.1.b SDL doesn't change HMILevel, sets application to NOT_AUDIBLE   
1.g.1.c SDL reveives notification from HMI that event is over  
1.g.1.d SDL restores HMILevel of app being in effect before event by sending
