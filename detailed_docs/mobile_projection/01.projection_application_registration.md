## Use Case 1: Projection application registration over USB transport

**Main Flow:**

_Pre-conditions:_  
a. device successfully connects over USB transport  
b. mobile application with `appID` is registering on SDL  
c. "appHMIType" = PROJECTION


_Steps:_  
1. Mobile application sends registering request

_Expected:_
1. SDL validates parameters of the request
2. SDL checks if PROJECTION appHMIType is NOT allowed by Policies
3. SDL transfer request to HMI  
4. SDL receives response from HMI  
5. SDL transfers response to mobile application


**Exception 1:**  
1.a.1 Request is invalid: Wrong json, parameters of wrong type, string parameters with empty values or whitespace as the only symbol, out of bounds, wrong characters, missing mandatory parameters  
1.a.2 SDL responds INVALID_DATA, success:false to application  

**Exception 2:**  
2.a.1 PROJECTION appHMIType is NOT allowed by Policies  
2.a.2 SDL responds DISALLOWED (success:false) resultCode to mobile app


## Use Case 2: Projection application registration over Bluetooth transport  

_Pre-conditions:_  
a. device successfully connects over Bluetooth transport  
b. mobile application with `appID` is registering on SDL  
c. "appHMIType" = PROJECTION

_Steps:_  
1. Mobile application sends registering request  

_Expected:_  
1. SDL validates parameters of the request
2. SDL checks if PROJECTION appHMIType is NOT allowed by Policies
3. SDL transfer request to HMI  
4. HMI responds with OnExitApplication (`<appID>`, reason = UNAUTHORIZED_TRANSPORT_REGISTRATION)  
5. SDL unregisters the app  
6. SDL clears all internal information about app's with `<appID>` non-responded RPCs 
7. SDL ignoreS all responses and notifications from HMI associated with `<appID>` if received from HMI
