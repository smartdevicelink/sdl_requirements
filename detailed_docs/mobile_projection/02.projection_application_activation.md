## Use Case 1: Projection application activation

_Pre-conditions:_  
a. mobile application is successfully registered on SDL  
b. appHMItype=PROJECTION (isMedia = true)  
c. application is in any HMILevel other than FULL on HMI  

_Steps:_  

1. SDL receives receives request from HMI to activate application  

_Expected:_  
2. SDL activates application  
3. SDL sets application to FULL HMI Level, audioStreamingState AUDIBLE

Exception 1  
b.1 appHMItype=PROJECTION (isMedia = false) - > SDL sets application to FULL HMI Level, audioStreamingState NOT_AUDIBLE

## Use Case 2: Projection application activation after postponed HMILevel resumption 
_Pre-conditions:_  
a. mobile application is successfully registered on SDL  
b. appHMItype=PROJECTION (isMedia = true)  
c. application is in `<default_HMILevel>` due to postponed HMILevel resumption (postponed during VR session, Emergency_Event, Deactivate_HMI, PhoneCall)  

_Steps:_  

1. SDL receives receives request from HMI to activate application  

_Expected:_  
2. Event for postponing HMILevel resumption ends  
3. SDL activates application  
4. SDL sets application to FULL HMI Level, audioStreamingState AUDIBLE  

Exception 1  
b.1 appHMItype=PROJECTION (isMedia = false) - > SDL sets application to FULL HMI Level, audioStreamingState NOT_AUDIBLE  

## Use case 3: Projection application activation during active embedded audio source  
_Pre-conditions:_  
a. mobile application is successfully registered on SDL  
b. appHMItype=PROJECTION (isMedia = false)  
d. embedded audio source is active  
c. application is BACKGROUND HMI Level and audioStreamingState NOT_AUDIBLE  

_Steps:_  

1. HMI sends notification that embedded audio source is not active   
2. HMI sends request to activate application  
 
_Expected:_  

3. SDL activates application  
4. SDL sets application to FULL HMI Level, audioStreamingState AUDIBLE  

Exception 1  
d.1 embedded navigation source is active  
d.2 application is BACKGROUND HMI Level and audioStreamingState NOT_AUDIBLE  
d.3 HMI sends notification that embedded navigation source is not active   
d.4 HMI sends request to activate application  
d.5 SDL activates application  
d.6 SDL sets application to FULL HMI Level, audioStreamingState AUDIBLE
