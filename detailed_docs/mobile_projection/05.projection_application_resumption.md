## Use Case 1: Data resumption for projection application

**Main Flow:**  

_Pre-conditions:_  
a. device successfully connects over USB transport  
b. PROJECTION application with `appID` on `deviceID` is registered on SDL  

_Steps:_  

1. application has been disconnected as a result of unexpected transport disconnect 
2. application  sends RegisterAppInterface request with `<hashID>` value stored for this app  
and other valid params

_Expected:_  
3. SDL checks all Policies rules and performs DUPLICATE_NAME check 
4. SDL start Data Resumption process for this application  

**Alternative flow 1:**  
1.a.1 application disconnectes gracefully  
(e.g. user turn off mobile app via UnregisterAppInterface)  
OR app unregisteres by SDL via OnAppUnregistered notification by any reason)  
1.a.2. SDL cleans up all the data persisted for `<appID, deviceID>` pair in the DB

**Alternative flow 2:**   
2.a.1 application sends RegisterAppInterface request with `<hashID>` NOT equal to the value stored for this app  
2.a.2 SDL interrupts Data Resumption process for this application
